# sfguide-getting-started-with-end-to-end-customer-targeting-on-snowflake-ml

## Overview

Companies increasingly use machine learning to drive targeted customer campaigns, improving engagement and boosting conversion rates. This project demonstrates how to implement **propensity-based targeting** directly within **Snowflake**, allowing your entire ML workflow to run where your data already residesâ€”eliminating data movement and significantly improving performance and efficiency.

## What's Inside

This guide walks through a complete, end-to-end machine learning workflow within the Snowflake environment using **Snowflake Notebooks**, **Snowpark**, and other native Snowflake tools. You'll learn how to:

- Perform feature engineering directly in Snowflake
- Manage features with a centralized **Feature Store**
- Train models at scale using Snowpark
- Register and version models using **Model Registry**
- Run inference within Snowflake
- Integrate all steps in a cohesive pipeline using Snowflake Notebooks

## Why This Approach?

- **No data movement**: All data and processes remain inside Snowflake
- **Improved speed and efficiency**: Benefit from Snowflake's scalability and performance
- **End-to-end pipeline in one platform**: Simplifies development and deployment

## Technologies Used

- **Snowflake Notebooks**
- **Snowpark** for scalable data processing
- **Feature Store** for centralized feature management
- **Model Registry** for deployment and version control
